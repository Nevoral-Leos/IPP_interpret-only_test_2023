# IPP_interpret-only_test_2023
VUT FIT - class IPP project 2 tests
Should test mostly dynamic typing and obvious right and wrong functionalities of instructions.
Some tests are generated and some are made by hand, so there is a room for error, if you find any, just create a pull-request.
Tests don't cover XML format errors, so if anyone has some great ones for that, i'd love to add them.
